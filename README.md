# Raven Coffee Mod
Hello! If you happen to find yourself here let me offer you a cup of coffee, I hope you'e doing well.
Anyways, welcome to the page for my first published mod.
>This is just an introduction to the project, nothing really important here

I was inspired to mod the game by all the new changes that are coming to the Caves & Cliffs minecraft update. I already wanted coffee on minecraft but I also want to make something that feels like part of the vanilla experience.

For now I'll just make averything that I can, coffee ingot, coffee swort, coffe pig, coffee creeper, coffee coffee (?) Mostly because I want to learn how to make anything so my creativity can flow.

if you have any other suggestions feels free to send me a message, post, anything you'd like (don't stalk me please). You can follow or dm me [@T_WandererRaven](https://twitter.com/T_WandererRaven) on twitter.
